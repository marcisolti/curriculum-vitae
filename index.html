        <h3>simulating deformables</h3>
        <p>
            during my msc in applied mechanics, a big project of mine was exploring the craftsmanship of deformable simulations in the entertainment industry. 
        </p>
        <p>
        of course, i started with the easy stuff - linear models <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W4R46_Uljp8">like this</a> - but quickly moved further to the field of nonlinear finite element method and continuum mechanics. i ended up implementing the hyperelastic projected newton solver by pixar, presented <a href="https://graphics.pixar.com/library/AnalyticEigensystems/">here</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
        here is a <b>video</b>;
        </p>
        <p>
        you can get a wip version of my <b>thesis</b> <a href="./marcisolti-hyperelasticFEM.pdf">here</a>,
        </p>
        <p>
        and a highly wip version of my c++/directx 12 <b>simulator</b> here.<br>
        </p>
        <p>
        any feedback is more than welcome at <a href="mailto:marci.solti.hu@gmail.com">here</a>.
        </p> 
        <p><b>in a nutshell</b>, if you want compute physics, you need to find some state variables characterizing the system's response - i.e. how much energy (\(\Psi\)) is accumulated in a small cube of material if we squish it to be half the size it was before. 
        </p>
        <p>    
        if you apply some external forces \(\mathbf{f}_{ext}\) on your deformable, in turn, internal forces \(\mathbf{f}_{int}\) appear inside of it, which is calculated from 
        $$\mathbf{f}_{int} = \frac{\partial \Psi}{\partial\mathbf{x}}$$
        so easy, just take the derivative! the internal forces equal the energy jacobian. you have now a nice equilibrium
        $$\mathbf{f}_{int}-\mathbf{f}_{ext} = \mathbf{0}$$
        you can timestep forward in time this equilibrium by plugging it into a newton solver; however it means that you need to take the derivative again, which is going to be the energy hessian, that is
        $$\mathbf{K} = \frac{\partial^2\Psi}{\partial\mathbf{x}^2}$$
        yes, just take the derivative; again! however, there's an evil professor trick lurking here: \(\mathbf{K}\) is a fourth-order tensor, and some instabilities can appear if try to e.g. squish the little cube too fast, or squish it to the point it becomes a pancake. 
        <p>
        following <a href="https://graphics.pixar.com/library/AnalyticEigensystems/">smith et al.</a>, i went through the painstaking analysis of some specific energy functions to find out that you can also reassemble the whole energy hessian \(\mathbf{K}\) from the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of it (as \(\mathbf{K}=\mathbf{Q\Lambda Q}^T\)) which can be aquired in closed form! 
        </p>
        <p>
        this is so cool, because the instabilities appear as \(\mathbf{K}\) becomes indefinite, so we need to just clamp the eigenvalue to \(0\) if it's less than \(0\). 
        </p>
        <p>
        man! all of this might sound suspiciously intellectual for you, but i just copied the equations from the pixar paper and it worked. :)
