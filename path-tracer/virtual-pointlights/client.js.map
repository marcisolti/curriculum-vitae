To initiate a call to this deep recursive function use its [invoke] function.\n * As a rule of thumb, it should be used if recursion goes deeper than a thousand calls.\n *\n * The

Other instances of [DeepRecursiveFunction] can be called\n * in this scope with `callRecursive` extension, too.\n *\n * For example, take a look at the following recursive tree class and a deeply\n * recursive instance of this tree with 100K nodes:\n *\n * ```\n * class Tree(val left: Tree? = null, val right: Tree? = null)\n * val deepTree = generateSequence(Tree()) { Tree(it) }.take(100_000).last()\n * ```\n *\n * A regular recursive function can be defined to compute a depth of a tree:\n *\n * ```\n * fun depth(t: Tree?): Int =\n *     if (t == null) 0 else max(depth(t.left), depth(t.right)) + 1\n * println(depth(deepTree)) // StackOverflowError\n * ```\n *\n * If this `depth` function is called for a `deepTree` it produces [StackOverflowError] because of deep recursion.\n * However, the `depth` function can be rewritten using `DeepRecursiveFunction` in the following way, and then\n * it successfully computes [`depth(deepTree)`][DeepRecursiveFunction.invoke] expression:\n *\n * ```\n * val depth = DeepRecursiveFunction<Tree?, Int> { t ->\n *     if (t == null) 0 else max(callRecursive(t.left), callRecursive(t.right)) + 1\n * }\n * println(depth(deepTree)) // Ok\n * ```\n *\n * Deep recursive functions can also mutually call each other using a heap for the stack via\n * [callRecursive][DeepRecursiveScope.callRecursive] extension.
